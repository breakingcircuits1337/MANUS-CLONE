# AI Agent Application Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for a comprehensive AI agent application with natural language processing, web scraping, and data analysis capabilities. The application uses a Streamlit graphical user interface and is designed for local desktop deployment with session persistence.

## System Components

### 1. Core System
- **Application Controller**: Central coordinator that manages the flow between different modules
- **Session Manager**: Handles persistence of conversations and data between sessions
- **Configuration Manager**: Manages application settings and API credentials

### 2. User Interface Layer
- **Streamlit GUI**: Provides an interactive interface with:
  - Chat interface for NLP interactions
  - Data visualization components
  - Web scraping input and results display
  - Settings and configuration panel
  - Memory management (including reset functionality)

### 3. Capability Modules
- **NLP Module**: Processes natural language inputs and generates responses
  - Integrates with multiple LLM providers (Gemini, Mistral, Groq, Ollama)
  - Handles context management for conversations
  - Implements prompt engineering techniques

- **Web Scraping Module**: Extracts data from websites
  - URL input and validation
  - HTML parsing and content extraction
  - Data cleaning and structuring
  - Rate limiting and respectful scraping

- **Data Analysis Module**: Processes and analyzes structured data
  - Data import/export functionality
  - Statistical analysis tools
  - Data visualization generation
  - Report creation

### 4. Integration Layer
- **API Integration Manager**: Handles communication with external services
  - Google services connector
  - Gemini API connector
  - Mistral API connector
  - Groq API connector
  - Ollama connector (local model integration)

### 5. Data Layer
- **Memory Store**: Persistent storage for:
  - Conversation history
  - User preferences
  - Scraping results
  - Analysis outputs
  - Temporary data cache

## Data Flow

1. User inputs query/request through Streamlit interface
2. Application Controller processes request and routes to appropriate module
3. Selected module processes request, potentially calling other modules or external APIs
4. Results are returned to Application Controller
5. Session Manager updates persistent storage if needed
6. UI is updated with results
7. Cycle repeats for new inputs

## Persistence Mechanism

- SQLite database for structured data storage
- JSON files for configuration settings
- Pickle files for session state preservation
- "Forget" functionality that clears specific or all persistent data

## Extension Points

- Plugin architecture for adding new capabilities
- Configuration options for adding new API providers
- Custom prompt templates for different NLP tasks

## Dependencies

- Streamlit: UI framework
- Requests/BeautifulSoup: Web scraping
- Pandas/Numpy: Data analysis
- API client libraries for LLM providers
- SQLite: Local database storage
- Various utility libraries (logging, etc.)

## Deployment Considerations

- Local installation with minimal setup requirements
- Environment variable management for API keys
- Resource management for efficient operation on desktop hardware
